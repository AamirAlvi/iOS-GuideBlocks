## Multiple Choice Survey (MultiSelectSurvey)

This is a terrific example about how complex or very custom use-cases can be deployed and easily used by your Product Team. Its the best of Code and No-code combined! Extend your Apps capabilities once, THEN

* launch once, twice, many times
* to specific users and
* measure results.

1. Create an account at [Contextual Dashboard](https://dashboard.contextu.al/ "Contextual Dashboard").
2. Repeat the steps 1-5 above. In the code for the wrapper make it's name *MultipleChoiceCustom*

`
{
  "guideBlockKey": "MultipleChoiceCustom"
}
`

3.  In the sidebar under the relevent sections:
 * Edit the title, content
 * Change the Question and the Answer options
4. Save the guide and show to your Product Team, once you release this version of the App they can launch Multiple Choice Survey to whoever they want, whenever they want.
